# Stuff to do after busco:

## Compare quality of genomes
- see if there are buscos that correspond to the enzymes
- see which buscos are present in most genomes
- determine a rule to filter out genomes that are incompatible

*all genomes selected should have the same buscos present* so that to make the phylogeny comparison using buscos possible
There are no such buscos present, so the threshould is set to 90% of genomes should have a busco to include it

## Retrieve enzyme sequences
either 
- get sequences from genome annotations
- get sequences from blasting
retrieve at start lys1 and see how that goes

## Phylogeny 
make comparisons between the genomes:
- using buscos
- using enzymes (at start lys1)
