# Current to do list

- generate correlation numbers for all the graphs
- implement nulcear localization somehow for the esm-c umap graphs
    - still have to write about it 
    - update the text with the new figure stacked bar
- integrate kcat predictions somehow
- introduction
- correlation between enzyme phylo and maybe esm-c distances
    - done 

# Could do list

- protein engineering
    - change the localization for the protein
- analyze more structures
    - could determine by clustering the esm-c embeddings
