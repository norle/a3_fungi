# Current to do list

- generate correlation numbers for all the graphs
- implement nulcear localization somehow for the esm-c umap graphs
- integrate kcat predictions somehow


# Could do list

- protein engineering
    - change the localization for the protein
- analyze more structures
    - could determine by clustering the esm-c embeddings
