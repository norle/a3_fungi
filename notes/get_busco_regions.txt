When running **BUSCO** (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs), the identified regions in the genome are stored in the output files. Here’s where you can find the relevant information:

### 1. **Identified Regions (Coordinates)**
   - The file:  
     ```
     run_<lineage>/full_table.tsv
     ```
   - This file contains a table with columns, including:
     - **BUSCO ID** (e.g., specific gene name)
     - **Sequence ID** (contig or scaffold name)
     - **Start and End Coordinates** (if applicable)
     - **Score and Status** (Complete, Fragmented, Missing)

   **How to extract coordinates:**
   ```
   awk '$2 == "Complete" {print $1, $3, $4, $5}' run_<lineage>/full_table.tsv
   ```
   This will print the BUSCO ID, contig name, start, and end positions of complete genes.

### 2. **Extracting the Identified Sequences**
   - The identified sequences are stored in:
     ```
     run_<lineage>/busco_sequences/
     ```
   - The folder contains:
     - `single_copy_busco_sequences/` → Single-copy ortholog sequences
     - `fragmented_busco_sequences/` → Incomplete sequences
     - `duplicated_busco_sequences/` → Multiple copies detected
   - If you need all sequences, check:
     ```
     run_<lineage>/busco_sequences/complete_busco_sequences.fna
     ```
     This file contains the **FASTA sequences** of all complete BUSCO genes.

### 3. **Extracting Regions from Genome**
   If you have the coordinates and need to extract these regions from your genome file (`genome.fasta`), you can use **BEDtools**:

   1. Create a BED file from `full_table.tsv`:
      ```
      awk '$2 == "Complete" {print $3, $4-1, $5, $1}' OFS="\t" run_<lineage>/full_table.tsv > busco_regions.bed
      ```
   2. Extract sequences:
      ```
      bedtools getfasta -fi genome.fasta -bed busco_regions.bed -fo busco_extracted_sequences.fasta
      ```

This will create a **FASTA file with the extracted BUSCO sequences from the genome**.
